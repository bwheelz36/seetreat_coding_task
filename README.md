# seetreat_coding_task

1. fork this repository.
2. Write some C++ code which reads and displays the stop sign image in this repo
3. Add some input checks - for instance: does the file exist? Is the image size acceptable (feel free to define some upper bounds on image size for instance). Is the image grey scale or RGB...etc.
4. Add some code that finds the location of the stop sign. hint: Keep this simple. We are looking for a simple thresold based approach, not a deep learning implementation!
5. Write test cases for this code.
6. Write a 'build_instructions.md' describing how to build and run this code using markdown language
7. Write a 'test_instructions.md' describing how to run the tests
8. make a pull request back to the main branch

## other points

- you are welcome to but need not use cmake for build.
- You are welcome to but do need not use third party libraries such as openCV. (but if you do make sure the build instructions reflect this)
- You are welcome but do not need to use some existing test framework.
